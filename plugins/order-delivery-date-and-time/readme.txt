Woocommerce's Order Delivery | Pickup Date and Time Planner allows you to plan your store's delivery and pickup, as well as pre-set specific days and holidays.

== Description ==
Don't keep your shoppers worried about their order delivery. A systematic order delivery planning can bring you regular customers and enhance their shopping experience by offering home delivery and self-pickup. 

== How it works ==
The Order Delivery | Pickup Date And Time Planner For Woocommerce plugin allows your customers to pick their preferred delivery/pickup date and time from the checkout page. The admin has the privilege to choose any unavailable days for delivery/pickup service, and to add specific days to set separate slots for those days. Depending on the needs of the store owner, bulk or individual slots can be specified.

== Date Planner for Easy Delivery ==
*	Enable the delivery date picker option to activate the delivery date on your store’s checkout page.
*	Pre-set the processing time for prepping the delivery at your store’s convenient time. 
*	You can set valid days for delivery and limit the number of dates to be picked by the user. 
*	Select any start day of a week.
*	Pick a suitable date format. 
*	‘Auto Select First Available date’ option lets you automatically select the very next available date on the calendar for delivery. 
*	Choose Off Days which you won’t be available for delivery.

== Delivery Time Setter ==
*	Enable the delivery time picker option to activate the delivery time on your store’s checkout page.
*	Add a new time slot convenient for your store to deliver customers’ orders.
*	Enable the Delivery Time option and select your preferred time slot type.
*	Select the time slot type of your choice from the drop-down
	* Individual Time Slot
	* Bulk Time Slot 		
*	Pick Time Slot as per date or week base:
	* Week Days
	* Specific Dates
*	Based on the Time Slot Type selected, set the From & To time range.
	(If the time slot type is Bulk Time Slot, then enter slot duration and intervals between each slot.)

== Special Occasion Slot ==
